    A class to interface with a remote PostgreSQL database for calibration data.

    This class extends `CalibrationDB` and is intended to provide methods for
    interacting with a remote database, such as the KOA PostgreSQL database.
    Currently, it serves as a placeholder for future implementation of remote
    database-specific functionalities.

    Note:
        Additional methods for remote database operations will be implemented here
        as development progresses.
